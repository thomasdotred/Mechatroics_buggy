# Mechatroics_buggy

## Module	Aims
The	module	will	provide	the	students	with	an	understanding	of	the basic	elements	of	mechatronics,	
i.e.	 computer-aided	 design,	 sensors,	 signal	 conditioning,	 displays,	 actuators,	 control	 systems	 and	
system	 response,	 and	 microcontrollers. The	 student	 will	 learn	 how	 to	 simulate	 the	 electronic
components	of	mechatronics	systems	using	CircuitLab	(www.circuitlab.com) and	to	design	mechanical	
components	in	SolidWorks.	They	will	also	learn	how	to	prototype	applications	using	components	and	
breadboard.	 The	 basic	mathematical	models	 of	mechatronics	 systems	 will	 be	 learned	 and	 applied	
through	practical	problem	solving. A	mini-project	will	be	carried	out	to	apply	a	microcontroller	to	a	
practical	application,	integrating	the	learnt	components	of	the	module.

## Buggy project objectives
- To construct a mechanical system comprising of a vehicle platform with 2
independently driven wheels and a single castor wheel â€“ this is based on the
Dagu Magician chassis;
- To operate the driven wheels with PM DC brush motors via the Adafruit
motor shield connected to an Arduino Uno and associated software;
- To attach 1 or more line sensors to the buggy and connect these to the
Arduino Uno and operate these with associated software;
- To attach a servo-driven pan & tilt mechanism to the buggy to control the
orientation of an ultrasonic distance transducer; to control the pan & tilt
mechanism via the motor shield / Arduino Uno and associated software; to
connect the US distance sensor to the Arduino Uno and operate with
associated software;
- To programme the buggy to follow a black line on a white background whilst
avoiding collisions with the surroundings.
